# Web-Scraping-Yelp-Reviews
Yelp is a popular website which provides business reviews along with user data and ratings. 
Using Python, I have analyzed sentiments about Kagura, a restaurant where I am working parttime. By creating this, I was able to show the manager how Kagura is doing compared to the other Japanese restaurants in Torrance and see how we can improve. 
This coding can be applied to any restaurant as long as you change the URL.
